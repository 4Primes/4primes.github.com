The first of Free Web Days event was held on 15-16 October 2010 at Yeditepe University, Istanbul. Detailed information about the event could be found at the <a href="http://www.ozgurwebgunleri.org.tr/" target="_blank">official web site</a> (in Turkish). As the representative of 4Primes, I submitted for a talk about <cite>Modelling Enterprise Entities Using Inheritance Mapping and Polymorphism provided by Hibernate Framework</cite>. My actual aim was to share my experience with Hibernate Inheritance Mapping and pragmatic approaches to the Enterprise Entity Modelling paradigm. You may look at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/FehmiSaglam/ozgur-webgunlerisunum" target="_blank">my presentation</a> after reading this blog.

Our journey to Istanbul with Umut started from Ankara train station. We chose to travel by train because we really, really get bored while travelling by bus. During the night we enjoyed some beer, discussed about the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287785046&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Coders at Work</a> and the history of religions all over the world. I slept for two hours on the wide and comfortable seats of <a href="http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495" target="_blank">Fatih Express</a>. Then I continued working on my presentation for Free Web Days. I finished most of the code samples on the train. After this long but entertaining trip on Fatih Express we finally arrived at Haydarpaşa on the morning of October 15th. It was sure an entertaining adventure.

Then I passed to Yeditepe University. CSS Sprites, HTML 5, Web security, Erlang web applications were my favourite talks on the first day of the event. On the second day the seminar about Apache Cassandra was very exciting. We decided to embed this technology into <a href="http://www.zinncir.com/">Zinncir</a>. At 15:00 I started my talk. There were 20 smth listeners and I think the speech was useful for most of them. Hande took some photos of the presentation. I will add them here soon. Actually they are already added to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/album.php?aid=26860&amp;id=123664484350712" target="_blank">4Primes Facebook page</a>. In the meantime you may look at the photos and may comment on them.

I really enjoyed Free Web Days and am going to try to attend to the event next year. If you have listened to my talk any comments here would be appreciated.
